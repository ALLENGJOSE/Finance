        <p>Money makes the world go round and indeed it is integral to our lives . But only few understand what it is like to keep money and make money .
            According to Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center  only 33 percent of adults are financially literate and only 30% indians have a basic understanding of finance. 
            The result is people fall victim to financial scams, buy horrible products and lose out on the better returns.</p>

        <p>Therefore it is very important to understand why understanding financial instruments becomes so crucial for us .</p>

            of the money. Therefore in simple terms if we were buying something today at rupees 100 then next year that money 's value would have dropped 
            down further. This is Inflation . Therefore everybody needs to learn investing as it is necessary to beat inflation.</p></div>
