        </h1>
        <h2>What is Financial Literacy</h2>
        <p>Money makes the world go round and indeed it is integral to our lives . But only few understand what it is like to keep money and make money .
            According to Global Financial Literacy Excellence Center  only 33 percent of adults are financially literate and only 30% indians have a basic understanding of finance. 
            The result is people fall victim to financial scams, buy horrible products and lose out on the better returns.</p>
