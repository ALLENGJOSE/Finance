        <h1 class="topic">Gold : The Most Loved Asset In Indian Households</h1>
        <fieldset class="info">
        <p>
        India is the second biggest gold consumer in the world - with 3 in every 4 households owning some form of gold.
        And it's no hidden secret that the yellow metal has been considered the most lucrative investment opportunitiy over the years.</p>
        </fieldset>
        <fieldset class="info">
        <p> In fact , from <b>2018-2023</b> , the compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of gold
        in India was almost<b> 15%, outperforming the CAGR of other investment options </b> such as stocks and mutual funds.
        So now with all this said there are 5 popular ways of investing gold:
        <ul>
        <li>Jewellery</li>
        <li>Gold Coins</li>
        <li>Digital Gold</li>
        <li>Gold Exchange Trade Fund(ETF)</li>
        <li> Sovereign Gold Bond</li>
        </ul>
        
        </p>
        </fieldset>
     
        <fieldset class="info">
       <h2> Gold Jewellery:</h2> Always visit a reputed gold retailer as he/she might sell an 18 carat gold and label it as 22 carat gold , 
        therefore get the gold checked through the carat meter.
        Now lets take an example:Suppose you are buying a gold chain.<br>
        The charges would be as follows: Weight(10g)
        <ul>
        <li>Price of 22KT gold -Rupees6000</li>
        <li>Price of 10g gold -Rupees60000</li>
        <li>Making and wastage charge 12% - 7,200</li>
        <li>3% on Gold and 5% making charge -2160</li>
        </ul>
            Thereby a total sum of 69360 . Now if you decid to sell the chain after one year you would not get GST value and Making and Wastage charges,
            and would get a 90% buyback value only as the retailers have to keep their margins as well.
            Therefore in the current year considering that gold had a 10%rally
            <ul>
            <li>  Net price gold  - Rupees66000</li>
            <li> Buy back value - Rupees60000</li>
            </ul>  
            Therefore total sum of 60000 despite the 10 % rally , therefore not a great investment option 
            from returns perspective.
       </p>
    </fieldset>
       
        <fieldset class="info">
            <p>
       <h2>Gold Coins:</h2> 
        Example: Weight -10g<br>
        Price of 22KT gold -Rupees 60000<br>
        3% Making change - Rupees 1800<br>
        GST - Rupees 1890<br>
        Total Sum -63690<br>
        Now on selling:<br>
        GST - Rupees 0<br>
        Making Charges - Rupees 0<br>
        Net price of gold - 66000(Considering 10% rally>)<br>
        Buyback value of 98% - 1320<br>
        Total Sum - Rupees 64680<br>
        Therefore here a gain is seen.
       </p>
    </fieldset>
    <fieldset class="info">
       <p>
        <h2>Digital Gold</h2>
        Price - Rupees60000<br>
        3%GST - Rupees1800<br>
        6%Spread(to store and manage the physical gold that is backing this digital gold) - Rupees3600<br>
       Total Sum  - Rupees 65400
       This is a 9% loss instantly and even if gold surges 10 % ideally it is a gain of less than 1% even before considering taxes.
       Therefore not likely a good investment as well.
       </p>
       </fieldset>
       <fieldset class="info">
       <h2>Gold ETF</h2>
     <p>  Here a fund manages gold assets on behalf of its investors.Therefore if you buy the 
       shares then you get some ownership of the gold assets<br>
       Now the good thing is if gold rallys then you would get the appreciation 
       as well as these ETF's can be sold at any time on the stock exchange. But even better is that
       there is <b>no GST</b> , there is no making charges , there is no wastage charges.<br>
       Only thing one would have to pay would be an expense ratio which would be less than 1%.<br>
       But there is a thing for taxation , from April 2023 gold ETF's and gold funds will be treated as short term capital gains for less than 3 years.</p>
       </fieldset>
       <fieldset class="info">
       <p>    
    <h2>Sovereign Gold Bond</h2>
    ADVANTAGES:<br>
    NO GST <br>
    NO MAKING CHARGES <br>
    NO SPREAD<br>
    NO TAX<br>
    The government (the Sovereign) will ake a list of promises:<br>
    1.We will match the price of gold 8 years from now.<br>
    2.We will give you an additional interest of 2.5% every year.<br>
    3.If you dont sell these bonds for 8 years we will not tax the gains.<br>
    4.You can also sell these bonds after 5 years @ 20% tax with indexation benefits.<br>
    </p>
    <p>Therefore FINAL RATING(according to investment related purposes):<br>
        <ol type ="1">
        <li>Sovereign Gold Bonds</li>
        <li>Gold Etfs</li>
        <li>Gold Coins</li>
        <li>Digital Gold</li>
        <li>Gold Jewellery</li>
        </ol>
